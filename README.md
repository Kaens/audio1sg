 The comprehensive tracker and retro music format detection script for Detect-it-Easy (https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy)

Even counting how many formats it covers would be tiring, but basically I've been working over the entirety of http://modland.net/pub/modules/ .

Please use the latest build of DiE!
