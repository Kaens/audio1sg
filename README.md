 The comprehensive tracker/retro/exotic music format detection script for Detect-it-Easy (https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy)

Even counting how many formats it covers would be tiring, but basically I've been working over the entirety of http://modland.com/pub/modules/ .

Please use [the latest build](https://github.com/horsicq/DIE-engine/actions/) of DiE! (Click the latest workflow run, scroll down to the artifacts and choose yours.)

I've made this separate from DiE for the sake of flexibility, as DiE releases are rather slow per se, and keeping its sources cloned is very storage-heavy.

Changes are quite welcome; if you know more about a format, please add used software to sVersion, and add the sOptions (which are basically extra info fields) regarding orderlist lengths, pattern/instrument/sample counts, check for basic file integrity like pointers leading outside the file or impossible pattern counts or volumes (for example, to add credibility to some overly generic-looking signature scans) â€” and of course, make it more fun in general for the user who chose "Verbose"! Read more in detail at [TODO.md](TODO.md) (which also includes contribution guidelines).

Don't fear the algo-heavier scans: at its first release, the entire script's checking routine takes within 0.1 sec even with the sanity check-based detection.
